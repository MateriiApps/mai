**Is this safe?**

Like with most projects that attempt to reverse engineer a service, they are against the TOS.
This does not mean you'll automatically get banned though, since I have put a lot of effort
into emulating official clients exactly 1:1. This of course doesn't eliminate the possibility of getting
detected and your account getting actioned.
**If you are worried about being banned, please use an alt, or don't use the project altogether.**

As for security, our projects are open-source\* and you are welcome to read the source code,
decompile to look at release builds, and use network analysis tools like [HttpToolKit](<https://httptoolkit.com/>).
