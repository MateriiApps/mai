**Is this safe?**

Like with most projects that attempt to reverse engineer a service, they are against the TOS.
This does not mean you'll automatically get banned though, since we have put a lot of effort
into emulating official clients 1:1 in cases like OpenCord. This of course doesn't eliminate
the possibility of getting detected and actioned. **If you are worried about being banned,
please use an alt, or don't altogether.**

As for security, our projects are open-source\* and you are welcome to read the source code,
decompile to look at release builds, or use network analysis tools like [HttpToolKit](<https://httptoolkit.com/>).
